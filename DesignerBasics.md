# Transition from designer to developer

Based on some observed misunderstandings, I recommend all UI/UX designers to read the below
very carefully at least once!

## Developers can't read your mind!

Most devlopers, are not mind readers. Their job is to implement in code, what you have given them.

A very common situation where projects die early is when Western companies outsource their implementation
to software houses in the East. The Westerner designer thinks it's OK to cut corners and produce some
quite sloppy material, since the developers in the East will fill in the blanks, correct errors or at least
ask if there's something they don't understand.

_No, they won't!_

In many Eastern countries, it's a cultural thing: If you ask the customer what s/he means, you insinuate
that s/he has done a bad job which is hard to understand, so you don't want to ask the customer for
clarification. At the same time, the Westerner will always get a positive answer if asking "Do you
understand?", since answering No would indicate that you're not compentent enough to understand what
the customer wants.

They usually also have a very heavy workload. They need to finish the job quickly, so they can move over
to the next customer as soon as possible.

The standard SISO rule applies - Shit In gives Shit Out!

## Rules for easier handover

Please read, and follow [general advice](general.md) to make it easier to hand over the project to
developrs, and maintain it for a very long time.
