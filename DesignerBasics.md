# Basic facts for designers

Based on some observed misunderstandings, I recommend all UI/UX designers to read the above
very carefully at least once!

## Developers can't read your mind!

Most devlopers, are not mind readers. Their job is to implement in code, what you have given them.

A very common situation where projects die early is when Western companies outsource their implementation
to software houses in the East. The Westerner designer thinks it's OK to cut corners and produce some
quite sloppy material, since the developers in the East will fill in the blanks, correct errors or at least
ask if there's something they don't understand.

_No, they won't!_

In many Eastern countries, it's a cultural thing: If you ask the customer what s/he means, you insinuate
that s/he has done a bad job which is hard to understand, so you don't want to ask the customer for
clarification. At the same time, the Westerner will always get a positive answer if asking "Do you
understand?", since answering No would indicate that you're not compentent enough to understand what
the customer wants.

They usually also have a very heavy workload. They need to finish the job quickly, so they can move over
to the next customer as soon as possible.

The standard SISO rule applies - Shit In gives Shit Out!

## Some syntax doesn't work in source code

To avoid name confusion, you as a designer should give names to your components that also works in
source code. Some basic rules:

- Never ever use blanks in names!
- Only use the characters a-z, A-Z, _ and digits.
- Pay attention to casing, never use upper-case where it shall be lower-case and vice versa.
- Never start a name with a digit.
- Always base names on the American English language.
- Make the names distinct enough so they can be found easily using free text search.
- Never use the words new, old, next, last, previous or final.
- Keep decent lenght of all names (more on that in other chapters).
- Name all new components immediately after you created them.
- Consider everything as multiple! Add a sequence number to the end of the name, and have the same number of digits.
